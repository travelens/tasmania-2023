We were very tired after visiting the Botanical Gardens and returned back to the city for a very late lunch.

We passed through the Rose Garden Bridge and took a few photos of the east side of the city, including the [Scots Church](https://www.scotschurch.com.au/), the [Royal Hobart Hospital](https://www.health.tas.gov.au/hospitals/royal-hobart-hospital), [Theatre Royal](https://www.theatreroyal.com.au/) and the [Ronald McDonald House](https://www.rmhc.org.au/programs/houses/tas/ronald-mcdonald-house-hobart).

We had banh mi for lunch at [Ja and Jon](https://jajonbanhmi.com.au/).
