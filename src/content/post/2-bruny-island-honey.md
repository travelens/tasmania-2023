The Honey Pot and Bruny Island Honey are the houses of honey venues of the Wright familyâ€™s proudly-run lifelong collaboration between the family, the bees, and the Tasmanian Wilderness. They have about over 1000 hives which they move year-round to follow the blossoming flower trail so the bees can collect a variety of nectar from different floral sources. They take the bees to Lake Pedder, to Bruny Island, and to the Huon and Derwent Valleys, where they collect Leatherwood and Bush, Prickly Box, and Manuka Honey.

They extract and package all thei own honey themselves at their facilities in Judbury, Tasmania.

Everyone ordered Leatherwood Honey ice cream, which they are famous for. Tasmanian Leatherwood has a strong, unmistakable flavour sourced from a limited number of hive sites positioned in the South West of Tasmania. The Leatherwood tree itself prefers to be shrouded by a canopy in damper weather.
