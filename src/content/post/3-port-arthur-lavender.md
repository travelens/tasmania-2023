Our final stop for the day is [Port Arthur Lavender](https://portarthurlavender.com.au/).

Nestled within seven hectares (18 acres) of lavender, rainforest and lakes and overlooking the ocean at Long Bay, Port Arthur Lavender’s visitor centre and café showcase millennia-old uses of this fragrant flower alongside modern cuisine and a fully functioning essential oil distillery.

Despite the light rain, I strolled around the lavender trail and took a few photos around the farm. The distillery is where the lavender is processed.
