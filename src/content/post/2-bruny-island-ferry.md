We booked a whole day Bruny Island tour with [Tassie Tours](https://tassietours.com/bruny-island-tours.php). The itinerary includes a mixture of walking, picturesque locations and produce outlets.

Anni, the driver, picked us up in a van at 7:45am and after picking up a number of other passengers, we were off to Bruny Island!

We boarded the ferry at Kettering and soon were on the way to the island.

Fortunately, the day turned out to be bright and sunny, in start contrast to the dull and rainy day yesterday.
