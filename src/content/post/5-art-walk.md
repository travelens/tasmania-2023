We discovered there is quite a lot of street scattered around Hobart streets, with a lot located at Bidencopes Lane.

Incidentally, my basic faith in human nature was reaffirmed whilst I was taking these photos. I was in a very quiet alley, Lyn had moved on to the next street, no one was around me. Suddenly this stranger came up right next to me whilst I was taking a photo and said hello. I was a bit shocked, and I could have been scared or run away, but I trusted my instincts and gave him a friendly smile and said hello back. We chatted for a little bit, then he moved on. As he waved goodbye, he had the most angelic smile on his face.
