To top off this very Tasmanian day we head to the summit of kunanyi (Mt. Wellington). Amazingly, the rain and clouds cleared for us so we were able to get a great view of Hobart city and surrounds. Standing high above Hobart at 1271m on a clear day is nothing short of spectacular. Thatâ€™s almost 200 metres taller than the famed Table Mountain in Cape Town. 

It was very very windy and cold, with an apparent temperature taking wind chill into account at -13&deg;C. I was nearly blown away just trying to get to the viewing platform. As a consequence, very few people were willing to spend a long time here, and we all hurried back to the bus.

Nick is an excellent photographer and showed us many photos he has taken here, including one of the Australis Borealis, and one of the Disappearing Tarn, a phenomenon that only appears after heavy rainfall. The boulders form a small natural alpine pool (tarn) which is usually aquatic turquoise in colour.
