At [The Henry Jones Art Hotel history](https://www.thehenryjones.com/) and art collide. Located in the Hunter Street precinct, Hobart’s oldest waterfront warehouses have been thoughtfully reimagined as Australia’s first dedicated art hotel.

Through the rise and fall of industries, including Sir Henry Jones’ IXL jam empire, the harbourside location has been central to Hobart and its people. Today, the precinct hums with galleries, award-winning restaurants, bars and cafes.
