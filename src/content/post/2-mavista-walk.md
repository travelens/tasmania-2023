After Truganini Lookout, we went along Adventure Bay Road and then turned into Lockleys Road. We spotted an albino wallaby along the way.

Mavista nature walk is along a shaded gully filled with ancient and enchanting wet forest. Towering stringybarks, blackwoods, magnificent treeferns and a variety of understorey species can be enjoyed along the way. A cosy picnic shelter marks the start of the walk.
