The highlight of the day is the walk to Crescent Bay. It starts from the car park, then headed east along the coastline to Maingon Blowhole (1 hr 30mins return), Mount Brown (4 hr return) and Crescent Bay​ (4 hr return). ​

Crescent Bay is a sparkling bowl of wild sea cradled by vast sand dunes. The walk traverses a gentle coastal heath. Mt Brown offers 360 degree views including Tasman Island and Cape Pillar before dropping down into this secluded, magical bay.

The weather continued to rain, so we were pelted by nearly horizontal bullets of rain which made a loud sound on our raincoats. The wind was very strong whenever we were not protected by scrubs, and nearly blew us away. The Blowhole wasn't operating because the tide was too low.

We were glad when we reached the lookout to Crescent Bay. We contemplated continuing on to climb Mt Brown, but suddenly the weather became a lot worse and the rain became heavy. We decided to walk back to the car pack, and it was really cold and wet. Truly and unforgettable experience.
