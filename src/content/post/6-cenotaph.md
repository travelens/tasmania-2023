The Hobart Cenotaph is the main commemorative military monument for Tasmania and is the centre of Anzac Day commemoration services. Hobart's shrine of remembrance, this culturally important area sits close to the city, with commanding views of the river and the mountain.

The Cenotaph is the centre of Anzac Day commemoration services at dawn and mid-morning, and is the destination of the marching procession. On Anzac Day at the break of dawn, a lone bugler always plays the Last Post.

The Hobart Cenotaph is an Art Deco reinterpretation of a traditional Egyptian obelisk. The Cenotaph was originally erected to commemorate the war dead of Tasmania from World War I, but has had subsequent additions made for all conflicts since then in which Tasmanian soldiers have served.

The monument was designed by Hobart architectural firm Hutchinson and Walker, after their entry had won a public competition held in 1923 for the structure's design.

From here we can see great views of the city and also the Tasman Bridge.
