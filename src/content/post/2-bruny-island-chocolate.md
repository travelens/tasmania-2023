On the way back along Adventure Bay Road, we briefly stopped at the chocolate company. Apparently they specialise in handmade cream fudges, chocolate products, preserves and gifts.

I like the Peter Rabbit packaging, plus we discovered some mushrooms in a field that looked like they came from a fairy tale!
