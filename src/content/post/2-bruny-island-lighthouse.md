The heritage-listed 1836 Cape Bruny Lighthouse towers 114m above dramatic cliff tops and coves that form this wild rugged Tasmanian coastline of Cape Bruny.

When first lit in March 1838, the Cape Bruny Lighthouse was Tasmania’s third lighthouse, after the Iron Pot Lighthouse at the entrance to the River Derwent and the Low Head Lighthouse at the entrance to the River Tamar. It was Australia’s fourth lighthouse. It is now the country’s second oldest and longest continually staffed extant lighthouse.

Apparently to climb the 120 stairs to the lighthouse requires us to book a special tour. I just enjoyed the views of Courts Island, Courts Bay and Quiet Bay.
