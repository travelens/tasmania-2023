We decided to spend the weekend exploring Hobart, as we are tired after three consecutive days of day tours.

[Salamanca Market](https://www.salamancamarket.com.au) is Tasmania's most visited tourism attraction and runs each Saturday from 8.30 am to 3 pm, rain, hail or shine.

The market extends the full length of Hobart's historic Salamanca Place, from the silos end to the top of Davey Street. There is a huge selection of locally made products and one can meet the makers, the artisans, the designers and producers.

With over 300 stallholders, the market includes fresh produce from local growers, hot coffee, delicious breakfast and lunch options, lots of gift ideas and plenty of handmade products.

The market is one of those special places where there are plenty of handmade and home grown produce, mingle with the locals, enjoy the vibrancy and atmosphere, and discover the heart of a creative island.
