[Banjo’s Bakery Cafe](https://banjos.com.au/hobart) was founded in Tasmania in 1984 and has operated successfully since, growing to over 40 stores across Australia. The idea, unique at that time, was to provide a place which offered customers the opportunity to sit down and enjoy freshly baked breads and cakes or handmade treats for breakfast, lunch or a snack with a perfectly made coffee.

The food still is hand crafted, fresh each day and served in an environment which provides a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. We bake a superior loaf and our bread is still made the traditional way, preservative free, fresh, soft and delicious. From day one, customers were quick to respond to the Banjo’s experience – now, with more than 6.3 million customers visiting a Banjo’s store each year.

We had delicious hot cross buns, toasties and coffee here.
