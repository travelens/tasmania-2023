## Princes Wharf

[PRINCES WHARF No1](https://www.princeswharf1.com.au/) is located Hobart’s waterfront in the heart of the historic Salamanca, just 5 minutes walk from the Hobart CBD. It is often used for events. Nearby is the [Spirit of Hobart](https://www.hobarthistoriccruises.com.au/), a ship used for tour cruises.

## The Lady Nelson

Berthed at Elizabeth st Pier on Hobart's waterfront, the [Lady Nelson](https://www.ladynelson.org.au/ship) tallship is one of the most popular attractions for vistors and a much loved icon of Hobart's fascinating maritime history.

Built locally and launched in 1988, the current Lady Nelson is a replica of the original Lady Nelson involved in establishing the settlement of Hobart Town in 1804.

With her twin masts rigged with square sails based on the original ship's plans, the Lady Nelson offers a unique experience to step back in time to when sailing ships first graced the shores of Hobart.

## Brooke St Pier

[Brooke Street Pier](http://www.brookestreetpier.com/) is a four storey floating pier. It is both a building and a boat.

The concept recreates the former Brooke Street Pier with a modern innovative interpretation - using the maritime heritage and architecture of the precinct to deliver a new, vibrant working cruise/ferry centre.

The floating terminal is in essence a large floating barge, 80m long by 20m wide, on which sits the new lightweight diaphanous building.

The terminal thus rises and falls with the tide. This means that the structure will never be affected by global warming, although it will be low and close to the waterline.

The lightweight translucent/ transparent skin of the upper building acts like a conservatory in creating a passively heated indoor environment, which is augmented by hydronic heating cooling systems utilising the constant water temperatures under the pier itself.

From here, one can catch a ferry to [MONA](https://mona.net.au) - an eclectic private museum. We saw one of the ferries, the MR-II (MR stands for MONA ROMA), docked here.

## Bernacchi Tribute Sculptures

## 150 Years of the Foundation of Hobart

The monument commemorates 150 years of European settlement in Hobart which was founded in 1804 by Lieutenant Collins.

A plaque was added in 2004 on the 200th anniversary and lists the names of the first settlers. It also acknowledges the Mouheneenner People as original custodians of the land.

The first European settlement in the Hobart area began in 1803 as a penal colony and a defensive outpost at Risdon Cove, officially named Hobart on the eastern shores of the Derwent River. This was undertaken under British concerns over the presence of French explorers in the South Pacific. It began as a collection of tents and huts, with a population of 178 convicts, 25 marines, 15 women, 21 children, 13 free settlers and 10 civil officers.

In 1804 the settlement was moved was moved to a better location which was named "Hobart's Town" at the present site of Hobart at Sullivans Cove, making it the second oldest city in Australia.

## School of Creative Arts
