We started from the car park to the Maignon Bay Lookout of the rugged southern coastline before decending the steps to the spectacular Remarkable Cave.

From the large viewing platform there are exceptional views of Penguin Rocks and the bay. Wild waves pound away at the coastal rock below to create this dramatic coastline.

We then descended the 115 steps to view the aptly named Remarkable Cave. Surrounded by steep, ancient sandstone cliffsâ€‹, we viewed the cave from the custom-designed platform at the base.

The tunnel-shaped cave was formed through years of torment from crashing waves, eventually causing a wall of the sandstone cave to collapse and create the tunnel that stands today. Some of the collapsed rock from the cave can still be seen at the base of the cliffs.
