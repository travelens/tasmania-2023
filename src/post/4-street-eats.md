This event, which is run every Friday during daylight savings (from December to around Easter) at Franklin Square, is billed as "a hyperactive inner-city night food+drink market with a rotating cast of eclectic musical acts to keep you fed, watered + grooving."

We saw quite a few food stalls and a musician performing.
