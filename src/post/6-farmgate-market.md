We started Sunday morning with a visit to yet another local institution - the [Farm Gate Market](https://farmgatemarket.com.au/).

Every Sunday, come rain, hail or shine … Farm Gate Market turns Bathurst Street into a bustling farmers’ market.

Twelve years back, the market began with an honest and simple philosophy – that if you couldn’t eat it, drink it, grow it or meet the producer, then you wouldn’t find it at Farmy.

That ethos has always held true. And now, the little farmers’ market that began with just 12 producers has grown into an essential Sunday ritual for locals and one of the top five farmers’ markets in the country.

Tasmania’s distinct growing seasons make for an ever-changing array of produce and that’s what we celebrate every Sunday.

Staying true to what’s in season locally is reflected throughout the market; on fresh produce stalls, in artisan foods and on street food vendors menus.
