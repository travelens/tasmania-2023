[Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.bonorong.com.au/) is a Sanctuary for wildlife run by a passionate team of like-minded people. It's a social enterprise: a little business with a big heart. The skills and funds generated through the Sanctuary allow them to proactively address problems in our surrounding environment and communities.

Tassie Devils are close up; wallabies are freely hopping around the park and many more of our local favourites are easily discovered here. Nick timed our visit here for a Tasmanian Devil feeding, a fun and interactive experience with our special endangered Devils.

We also saw echidnas, and have an all too brief moment to feed the kangaroos roaming around the park.
