Today we venture further afield with [Tours Tasmania](https://www.tourstas.com.au/tours/mt-field-mt-wellington-devils/) on their "Mt field, Wildlife & Mt Wellington" day tour.

This tour encompasses Wilderness, Waterfalls & Wildlife! We get to walk among the giants on the Tall Trees track, see spectacular Russell Falls, visit the local Tassie Devils at feeding time and finish the day with expansive views of Hobart & beyond from kunanyi/Mt. Wellington.

Mt. Field National Park offers a variety of short walks and is one of Tasmaniaâ€™s oldest National Parks. Most famous for the beautiful Russell Falls & the Tall Trees, we explore the park with a series of short walks, before moving onwards to a wildlife park and making a side-trip to the top of Mt. Wellington/kunanyi above Hobart.

These photos are taken along the trip from the bus, which is driven by tour guide Nick. We mostly travelled following the River Derwent and crossed it several times.

We saw quite a lot of poppy seed and hemp farms along the road. As we all know, poppy seed is used for making opium amongst other things and hemp can be used to make marijuana, so with the right resources and chemical processes this could be a great place to live!

On the way back we passed through Bowen Bridge returning back to Hobart.
