After the lighthouse, we were all hungry, so we stopped at the [Hotel Bruny](https://www.hotelbruny.com.au/) located at Sunset Bay near Alonnah. Along the way, we passed through the beautiful Daniels Bay near Lunawanna.

Incidentally, the two small towns Alonnah and Lunawanna are named after the Aboriginal name for Bruny Island: Lunawanna-alonnah.

We also passed through the Bruny Baker on the way. The Bruny Baker is a cute little roadside stall on Bruny Island offering freshly baked sourdough for passers-by. Drop your cash in the honesty box, pick up a fresh loaf and enjoy a picnic breakfast on the beach. The sourdough is stored in the very cool vintage fridge on the corner of Sheepwash Road and Main Road. Whilst we were there, we saw the fridge being stocked up and there were a queue of cars waiting to buy the bread!

Nearby is Magnetic Island, a privately owned island that is available for rent.

We saw a general store and luxury accommodation cottages. After lunch, we walked along the beach.

We also saw an unusually decorated station wagon named "The Purple People Eaters."
