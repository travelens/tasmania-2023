After Battery Point, we were hungry and walked back to the city centre for lunch.

Along the way, we passed through the finish line for the [Hobart Airport Marathon](https://hobartmarathon.com.au/), which was scheduled for tomorrow. I pretended to cross the finish line and had a number of photos taken here.

Lunch was at another vegetarian restaurant called [Heartfood](https://heartfood.page/) and the food here was also delicious.

After lunch we wandered around Hobart to capture street art (next post) but I also took some photos of various buildings in Hobart.
