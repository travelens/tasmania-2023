This is our first flight since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2021, and we were a bit nervous as we were wondering what had changed. We have heard stories of delays and cancellations and lost baggage.

We had an early dinner at [Amah by Hojiak](https://www.hojiak.com.au/chatswood/) in Chatswood, before boarding a train to the airport. On the way, we discovered our flight has been delayed by approximately one hour. We spent time near the food court which was surprisingly comfortable.

The flight, although delayed, was uneventful and we landed safely and caught the airport shuttle bus to our hotel. We are staying at [Best Western Hobart](https://bestwesternhotelhobart.com.au/), which is newly refurbished and conveniently located in the heart of the city. The airport shuttle stopped on Collins St, and we had to walk up two blocks to Bathurst St. We were surprised that the journey was quite hilly, so it was difficult sliding luggage bags on the footpath, but we made it in the end.

The hotel room was spacious and comfortable, and there were good views of the south of the city from the balcony.
