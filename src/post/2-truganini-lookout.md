Our first stop after disembarking the ferry on Bruny Island is Truganini Lookout on the Bruny Island Neck Game Reserve.

Truganini (also known as Lallah Rookh; c. 1812 â€“ 8 May 1876) was an Aboriginal Tasmanian woman. She was one of the last native speakers of the Tasmanian languages and one of the last individuals solely of Aboriginal Tasmanian descent. She grew up in the region around Bruny Island.

The Neck is a narrow, long isthmus connecting the north and south ends of Bruny Island. It takes nearly 300 steps up the dunes to the lookout. From here we can see amazing 360 degree views of the water on both sides of the neck, as well as the rest of the island and mainland Tasmania. At the top of the lookout there is a memorial to Truganini (1812-1876) and to the Nuenonne people who inhabited lunawanna-alonnah (Bruny Island) before the European settlement of Bruny.
